# PFT Tracker

## What's the app?

PFT Tracker is a mobile app developed using React Native, Expo CLI, and Firebase's user authentication and RTDB. I created it to assist teachers in tracking and recording their students' fitness as outlined the Presidential Physical Fitness Test.

## Features

Create a secure account with just an email and password to save your data in the cloud. Create multiple classes that are partitioned from one another and each allow for a large number of students. Supported activities include: curl-ups, sit and reach, push-ups, pull-ups, flexed arm hang, mile run, and shuttle run. Activities that support a timer allow for a simple tap on a students name to save their time as they pass the finish line. The mile run has a unique feature: tap once for each lap completed. The fourth tap will save the final time. View student scores and award progress by tapping their name on the roster page.
